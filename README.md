# jqgrid-database
jqgrid version of the database interaction

This code is made for the same purpose as: https://github.com/ShayanMandegarian/bootstrap-database

The difference is, this one implements jqGrid for both the UI and the actual REST operations using Slim Framework.

Follow the same instructions on the other repository for how to get this code running, basically download this code into a folder,
and drop said folder into your server directory and access it via localhost on a browser.

Also, this code is required to be up and running to use SQLtoMySQL.py found in https://github.com/ShayanMandegarian/sqltomysql.
